# Comment out this line - MongoEngine models can't be registered with Django admin
# admin.site.register(ExpenseModel)

# Register your models here.
# Note: Django admin doesn't work with MongoEngine Documents
# You'll need to manage your MongoDB data through:
# 1. Your API endpoints
# 2. MongoDB Compass
# 3. Custom admin views (if needed)
